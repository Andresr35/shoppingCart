## Description

This project is meant to show off the usage of states being passed around child componenets and the use of useEffect hooks.

It is a project that creates a simple shopping website that grabs product information from the [Fake Store Api](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs).

The website allows you to add different products to your cart with the use of states around the different components.
